			<h2>Problem & Purpose</h2>
			<p>I started making this site as one of my "weekly projects" during my summer of 20XX, although the consistency didn't last too long. Most of my creations are things I make for the intrinsic joy of programming and I really only share it with the friends that would understand the effort put in. A personal website can serve as a public space I can leave my projects to share more broadly. I can also use it as essentially a blog for each of the projects.</p>
			
			<h2>Technical Decisions</h2>
			<p>With the product goal being a project showcase, I also had a couple of technical goals that reflect some of my web development ideals.</p>
			<h4>Progressive Enhancement</h4>
			<p>I would not call myself a front-end dev or designer simply because I don't care about how things look that much. The content should be able to stand alone. Everything should look good without CSS, and you can see that with the button at the bottom.</p>
			<h4>Lightweight</h4>
			<p>Pages should load fast. This project doesn't use any existing frameworks like react so the only JavaScript being pulled in is code that actually does something.</p>
			
			<h2>Architecture</h2>
			<p>Each component that I included is typed as a Blueprint, equivalent to a react functional component except that it just returns a string.</p>
			<code>const Component: Blueprint&lt;ComponentProps&gt; = (props) =&gt; `Content`</code>
			
			<p>Toggling the CSS is fairly simple, as its just a matter of disabling the stylesheet</p>
			<pre><code>
const stylesheets = Array.from(document.styleSheets);
stylesheets.forEach(sheet => {
    if (sheet.href && sheet.href.includes('clean.css')) {
        sheet.disabled = true;
    }
});
			</code></pre>
			
			
			<h2>Formatter</h2>
			<p>This one is bespoke for no reason. here's how it works</p>
			
			<h2>Tester</h2>
			<p>I haven't been keeping up with tests because this is mostly ui work but the formatter has unit tests, and this test engine is bespoke too.</p>
			
			<section>
				<h2>CSS Toggle Demo</h2>
				<p>This section demonstrates the CSS toggle functionality. The button below works independently of the main page toggle.</p>
				<p>This section should be deleted later</p>
				<div class="interactive-demo-container">
					<p id="demo-text">This text will change style when you toggle CSS for this section only.</p>
					<button id="section-toggle">Toggle Section CSS</button>
				</div>
				<script>
					(function() {
					const button = document.querySelector("button#section-toggle");
					const text = document.querySelector("p#demo-text");
					if (!button || !text) return;
					let cssEnabled = true;
					
					button.addEventListener("click", () => {
					cssEnabled = !cssEnabled;
					if (cssEnabled) {
					text.style.color = "black";
					text.style.fontSize = "1em";
					button.textContent = "Toggle Section CSS";
					} else {
					text.style.color = "red";
					text.style.fontSize = "1.5em";
					button.textContent = "Restore Section CSS";
					}
					});
					})();
				</script>
			</section>
		</main>
		
		<footer>
			<button onclick="toggleCSS()">Toggle CSS</button>

		<script>
			function disableCSSStyle() {
			const stylesheets = Array.from(document.styleSheets);
			stylesheets.forEach(sheet => {
			if (sheet.href && sheet.href.includes('clean.css')) {
			sheet.disabled = true;
			}
			});
			}
			function enableCSSStyle() {
			const stylesheets = Array.from(document.styleSheets);
			stylesheets.forEach(sheet => {
			if (sheet.href && sheet.href.includes('clean.css')) {
			sheet.disabled = false;
			}
			});
			}
			function toggleCSS() {
			const mainStylesheet = Array.from(document.styleSheets).find(sheet => 
			sheet.href && sheet.href.includes('clean.css')
			);

			enableCSSStyle();
