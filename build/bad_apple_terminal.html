			<h2>Problem & Purpose</h2>
			<p>I was bored in my highschool homeroom and I wanted to mess with the web terminal I had access to for a webdev class. I just wanted to render the Bad Apple animation in a terminal, but this project enables any video or image to be displayed.</p>
			
			<h2>Technical</h2>
			<p>Certain terminals can output in color with escape characters. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit">link</a>. For images, the task is fairly trivial where all I need to do get the raw image data using the library JIMP, scale the image, then map each pixel to a character with an escape code.</p>
			<img alt="Terminal rendering" />
			
			<p>For bad apple specifically, I had actually done similar work for the BadAppleCeleste project. That one contains a C++ program I wrote to convert a video into a file with RunLengthEncoding for White and Black. I reused the RLE file generated from there to reconstruct images that can be rendered to the terminal.</p>
			
			<!-- Cool interactive thing where I demonstrate run length encoding -->
			
			<p>For videos, I have a precompute step which saves the text with the escape characters into a file which can be read from later and printed at an appropriate framerate.</p>
